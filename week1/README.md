# Introduction:
For this assignment we were to build on top of the class example which was using the MobileNet model to classify objects via our webcams.

# Inspiration
After seeing the highly-anticipated horror film, "US", I became hooked on the remixed version of the classic Hip Hop song, "I Got Five On It, by Luniz. I was literally jamming to the song almost everyday, so I decided to pay homage to the film's soundtrack in my assignment.

# What I Did
Using the MobileNet Model, I determined that upon recognizing a $5 bill, the sketch would:
1. Commence playing the legendary song, "I Got Five On It"
2. Display some dope cover art of the Artist Group, Luniz, who created the song.



# Before 
Here is how my sketched look before identifying a five dollar bill:

# After 
After recognizing the 5 dollar bill, it triggered this change:
