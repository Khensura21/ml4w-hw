# Inspiration
Due to my love for health and fitness, I have become very cognizant of what I put in my body. Therefore, I wanted to implement a ML algorithim that could help me count my macros.

# What I Did
Specifically, I trained a ML to recognized probably my most consumed food items per day. These were:

1. Water
2. Bread
3. Peanut Butter 
4. Vegan Sausage

And depending on which food item was shown, a sketch would pop up that showed the average macronutrients like the image below.

# Recap
The code worked well and I was happy with the results, but it was a pretty trivial example. I look to develop this concept to make something more useful for myself and others potentially as Machine Learning has great potential to impact the Health, Fitness, and Nutrition fields.
