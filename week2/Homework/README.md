# Introduction:
For the second assigntment, we were to create something using PoseNET and/or the KNN classifier. 

# Inspiration
My project this week was inspired by the "Alphaversary" of when I joined my beloved Alpha Phi Alpha Fraternity Inc. (Black Greek Fraternity) back in Spring of 2017.

# What I Did
Using the PoseNet Model and the KNN Classifier, I created a program where I would train and classify specific symbols that was associated with the Black Greek Fraternities known as the "Big Three" to trigger the iconic song associated with them. The Big Three included Alpha Phi Alpha, Omega Psi Phi, and Kappa Alpha Psi. Each of these Frats had a song in which if you heard it on a college campus, you knew that that speific Frat would be getting ready to commence their patent, unique dances which are collquially known as "strolls" or "hops".

In my program the classify work in tandem with a callback function to do the following: 

1. Alphas' "Ice" symbol would trigger the song: "Wipe Me Down"
2. The Omegas' "Hook" symbol would trigger the song: "I'm a Dog"
3. The Kappas "Diamonds" symbol would trigger the song: "The Nasty Song"



# Reflection
This project filled me with nostalgia. It was much easier in the days of undergraduate, living seemingly carefree with the time and freedom to be in the limelight of attention and popular as a memeber of the fraternity. Now, it is the polar opposite as I find myself mostly in hibernation-mode from social events why I grit my way through expanding my skills and experience in this new field of creative coding/technologist I have become fond of. All in all, I look forward as I continue to develop my coding skils, to create things inspired my fantastic experience I had in undergraduate to remind myself to never stop having fun!

# Demo
